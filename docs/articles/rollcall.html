<a href="#d3-in-r" class="anchor"></a>D3 in R</h1>
<p>RStudio recently launched <code>R2D3</code>, giving <code>R</code> users the ability to render <code>D3.js</code> code in RStudio. For those in the data visualization field, this is a <em>really</em> exciting development. Now we can render <code>D3</code> code in <code>RMarkdown</code>, <code>R</code> script, or <code>Shiny</code>. We can also pass <code>R</code> objects (i.e. dataframes, datatables, etc.) to <code>D3</code> visualizations.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can wrap <code>r2d3</code> functions and include them in packages! As an example, I’ve taken Simon’s ideal point estimates <code>D3</code> code, rewrote it so that it would work in <code>r2d3</code>, wrapped the result up into a function called <code><a href="../reference/d3_rollcall_idealpoints.html">d3_rollcall_idealpoints()</a></code> and uploaded it to the <code>ussc</code> <code>R</code> package.</p>
<p>I’ll walk you through the steps to run the function. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3"><code>r2d3</code> website</a> if you want to learn more about <code>D3</code> in <code>R</code>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>r2d3</code>requires the daily build of RStudio.</p>
