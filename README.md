# ussc - The R Package for the United States Studies Centre
A collection of scripts and functions to help with research at the
United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.

## Setup
To install:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("usstudiescentre/ussc")
library('ussc')
```

Please note that the function `ussc_fonts()` loads automatically. Before installing the package from Github, download the Halis GR fonts from the Styles and Branding page on Confluence and add the files to your font book. This first step is crucial as many functions in this package will not work otherwise. 

If there are any problems, please note the issue at https://github.com/usstudiescentre/ussc/issues and contact the maintainer of the package.
